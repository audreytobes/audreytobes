# 🔐 Hello, I'm Audrey

I am a junior Computer Science student with an interest in cybersecurity and digital forensics. I’m passionate about understanding how systems work, how they fail, and how to protect them. I am currently developing hands-on skills in SOC analysis, DFIR, networking, and Python scripting to prepare for a career in cybersecurity.
