# 🔐 Hello, I'm Audrey

I am a junior Computer Science student with an interest in cybersecurity and digital forensics. I’m passionate about understanding how systems work, how they fail, and how to protect them. I am currently developing hands-on skills in SOC analysis, DFIR, networking, and Python scripting to prepare for a career in cybersecurity.

---

## 🎯 Objective
My goal is to secure an entry-level role as a **SOC Analyst** or **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) analyst**.  

I am currently:
- Completing my **B.S. in Computer Science (Cybersecurity minor)**  
- Building skills through **HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and Cisco Networking Academy**  
- Working on a research project for **NASA**:  
  *"Securing Artificial Intelligence in Space Exploration and Research"*  
- Studying for **CompTIA Network+**
