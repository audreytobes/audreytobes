# 👋 Hi, I’m Audrey Tobesman

I’m a **junior Computer Science student** with a focused interest in **cybersecurity, SOC operations, and digital forensics**. I’m driven by understanding how systems work, how they break, and how to defend them through detection, analysis, and incident response.

This GitHub serves as my **cybersecurity portfolio**, showcasing hands-on labs, networking projects, scripting, and research as I prepare for an entry-level role in **SOC Analysis or DFIR**.
