I am a junior in undergraduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems. I am eager to start my career in cybersecurity.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to become a penetration tester. I am currently working on finishing my B.S. in Computer Science (minors in Cybersecurity and Game Development), working with HacktheBox and TryHackMe to refine and gain skills in cybersecurity, and working on a research project for NASA, the topic is <i>Securing Artificial Intelligence in Space Exploration and Research</i>.
